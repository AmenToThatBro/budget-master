# budget-master

A small personal project to help me with five objectives:
  1. Become more familiar with Node.js and the Mongoose framework.
  2. Use the REACT library with a mixture of CSS to create a responsive webapp that will work with both PCs and mobile devices.
  3. Keep the design simple and tailored to an individual while creating the foundation for the sharing of budgets
     and household financial info to all authorized users.
  4. Creating a robust security plan for authorizing users and storing user information
  5. Integrate with Google's authentication infrastructure

After those are implemented who knows what I'll do.
